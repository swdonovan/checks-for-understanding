1. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?
  Syntatical changes along with additions of class's to simplify and give the ability to become an OOPL 
  
2. What's the difference between asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript? 
  Synchronous is the execution of a set of events or functions in a set order where the next executable set of commands will not execute until the previous executes.
  Asynch give JS the ability to use browser api's or node asynch libraries to simultaneously execute sets of code with one in the JS engine and then the other browser api or libraries but only allowing the asynch/browser api set of code to finish finish when the Engine's call stack is complete. 
  
3. What are the four pillars of Object Oriented programming?
  Abstraction
  Polymorphism
  Inheritance
  Encapsulation
  
4. What are some tools available in JavaScript to help you write object oriented code?
  Class's, constructors, prototypes, this, objects
  
5. What are some key concepts to be aware of when refactoring your JavaScript?
  four pillars of OOP
  clean/concise
  understandable
  asynch functions
  callbacks
  tests
  
6. What's a callback function and what are some reasons when we use/need callback functions?
  Callback functions all for the execution/responsibility of another set of code being packaged and transferred waiting to be exectued by the current function. 
  Ill work on this answer.
  
7. What's the scope of variables in Javascript?
  Scopes of variables are abstract definition of availability of a specific variable.
  
8. What's the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
  Triple ='s is a very specific comparative in JS that if I remember correctly will compare the modified times of certain compairing objects. 
  Double ='s Less specific usually a very intuitive comparitive for JS that checks the initial face value of objects being compared.
  
9. Why do front end frameworks exist?
  Some programmers despise HTML CSS & Vanilla JS.  Actually I think they exsist to provide an understandable structure for programmers to follow and keep their programs in an understandable orgranized manner. It allows the transfer or program between developers with a basic across the board understanding for all team members to follow.
  
#### Review  

10. Why do people say "HTTP is stateless"?
  Because information being transferred using HTTP is in stateless packages where it takes a request/response cycle for the browser to be able to retrieve the new package from the program. 
  
11. Describe a RESTful API.
  sends and recieves json or xml information through the HTTP transfer protocol

12. What are some main characteristics of a team following an agile workflow?
  Consistent meetings/ stand ups
  Organized visualization of program. Pivoting and adapting
  Iterations
  Scheduled sprints
  Client Meetings
  All Hands ownership meetings
  
13. What are some advantages **and** disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
  Advantages--> Provides seemless and fast onboarding of users where you as a developer won't have to manage the user information.
  Disadvantages--> Doesn't track and manage the information for the program using the OAuth service.
